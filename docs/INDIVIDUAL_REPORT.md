One of the biggest hurdles was learning how to use Maven. I wasn’t familiar with it before, so figuring out how it manages dependencies, how its build process works, and how to properly configure the pom.xml file took some time. I had to learn how to find and include libraries like the PostgreSQL driver and jBCrypt, and how different build phases and plugins fit together.

Another challenge was designing how the different parts of the app talk to each other—specifically, how the DAO layer (which I learned handles database queries) connects with the Service layer (the business logic). I had to make sure each part had a clear role so the code would stay clean and maintainable. This meant spending time figuring out how data flows between the main app, the services, and the database.

I also had to get comfortable with writing database logic in Java using JDBC. This included setting up and managing connections, and reading data from the database. I had to learn how to translate database results into Java objects and make sure everything was reliable.
